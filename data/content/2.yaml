          <h3>For pages:</h3>
          <ul>
          <li><b>Equivalent of backend_layouts</b><br>Sections in HUGO can be use as equivalent of "backend_layouts"
                 in TYPO3. This is working well except homepage (TODO).</li>
          <li><b>Content elements rendering</b><br>What is to be rendered on page is defined in front matter as "col_x"
                 where x is the id of column defined in "backend_layout". The "col_x" should have array of tt_content
                 uids. The minimal front matter for showing content would be then (YAML format):<br></li>
            <pre>

            title: About us
            layout: main_and_sidebar_right

            col_0:
              - 10
              - 31
              - 2

            col_1:
              - 113
              - 9
            </pre>

          </ul>
          <h3>For content elements:</h3>
          <ul>
          <li><b>Content elements templates as partials at /partials/content-*</b><br>Templates of content elements as
                 defined as partials. For example: layouts/partials/content-faq2.html</li>
          <li><b>Content elements data in /data/content</b><br>Data to render content element are kept in
                 /data/contant/x.yaml where x is equal to uid of content element in TYPO3.
                 You can consider this folder as equivalent of "tt_content" table form TYPO3.</li>
          <li><b>Multilang content</b><br>Data can be multilang. The file must then have the value of lang from url.
                 Like "/data/content/1.yaml" is default and
                 "/data/contant/1.de.yaml" is for german language.
          <li><b>Multilang content fallback</b><br>There is content fallback for multilang content. For example if
                 page is DE and there is no file "/data/contant/1.de.yaml"
                 then content from "/data/contant/1.yaml" is taken as fallback.
          <li><b>Content elements can be disabled/enabled</b><br>There is support for enable/disable single content
                 element. In TYPO3 there is "hidden" field for that. Here the field for that in data of content element
                 is "draft" (which is analogy for "draft" from front matter of page in HUGO)
          </ul>
